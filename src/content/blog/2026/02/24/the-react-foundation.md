[In October](/blog/2025/10/07/introducing-the-react-foundation), we announced our intent to form the React Foundation. Today, we're excited to share that the React Foundation has officially launched.

React, React Native, and supporting projects like JSX are no longer owned by Meta — they are now owned by the React Foundation, an independent foundation hosted by the Linux Foundation. You can read more in the [Linux Foundation's press release](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-announces-the-formation-of-the-react-foundation).

### Founding Members {/*founding-members*/}

The React Foundation has eight Platinum founding members: **Amazon**, **Callstack**, **Expo**, **Huawei**, **Meta**, **Microsoft**, **Software Mansion**, and **Vercel**. **Huawei** has joined since [our announcement in October](/blog/2025/10/07/introducing-the-react-foundation). The React Foundation will be governed by a board of directors composed of representatives from each member, with [Seth Webster](https://sethwebster.com/) serving as executive director.

### New Provisional Leadership Council {/*new-provisional-leadership-council*/}

React's technical governance will always be independent from the React Foundation board — React's technical direction will continue to be set by the people who contribute to and maintain React. We have formed a provisional leadership council to determine this structure. We will share an update in the coming months.

### Next Steps {/*next-steps*/}

There is still work to do to complete the transition. In the coming months we will be:

* Finalizing the technical governance structure for React
* Transferring repositories, websites, and other infrastructure to the React Foundation
* Exploring programs to support the React ecosystem
* Kicking off planning for the next React Conf

We will share updates as this work progresses.

### Thank You {/*thank-you*/}

None of this would be possible without the thousands of contributors who have shaped React over the past decade. Thank you to our founding members, to every contributor who has opened a pull request, filed an issue, or helped someone learn React, and to the millions of developers who build with React every day. The React Foundation exists because of this community, and we're looking forward to building its future together.
